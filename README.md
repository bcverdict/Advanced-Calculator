### Why not just use long?
As you're probably aware integers(in c++) have a limit to the size of integers can be. Even with an unsigned long 4294967295(also represented as 2^32) is the largest value it can store. But I wanted to push the limits on that. So with a combination of integer arrays
and table algebra I built an application using Visual Studios .NET framework (**after teaching myself managed c++**) that could handle problems such as 20,000 factorial as seen below. To grant perspective this number is approximately 2^256908.
