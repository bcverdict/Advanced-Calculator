# Advanced-Calculator

## Project Overview

The Advanced-Calculator project is a sophisticated calculator application capable of handling extremely large integers beyond the typical limits of standard data types in C++. By leveraging integer arrays and table algebra, this application can perform calculations such as the factorial of 20,000, a number approximately equal to 2^256908. This project was developed using Visual Studio's .NET framework after self-learning managed C++.

## Technologies Used

- **Development Environment:**
  - Visual Studio

- **Framework:**
  - .NET

- **Programming Language:**
  - Managed C++

## Features

- **High Precision Calculations:** Capable of handling extremely large numbers, such as 20,000 factorial.
- **Custom Algorithms:** Utilizes integer arrays and table algebra to surpass the limits of standard integer types.
- **User Interface:** Developed with Visual Studio to provide a robust and efficient user experience.

## Why Not Just Use Long?

As you may know, integers in C++ have a limit. Even with an unsigned long, the maximum value is 4,294,967,295 (2^32). This project aims to push these boundaries. By employing a combination of integer arrays and table algebra, the application can solve complex problems involving very large numbers, such as calculating 20,000 factorial, which is approximately 2^256908.
